        <h3>Environment</h3>
        <p>
          Life is too short to work with people you donâ€™t like. We are always
          looking for talented developers with a range of backgrounds,
          personalities, and skill sets who love to collaborate on cool projects
          and products.
        </p>

        <h3>Perks</h3>
        <p>
          We're remote friendly. While we require our developers be based in
          Malta, we're pretty flexible about working outside the office a couple
          of days a week if you need to.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We also have Beer Fridays (if you don't drink, no pressure), and an
          in-office gym is under construction for those who like to squeeze in a
          few breakfast reps.

          <p>
            Qualifications are nice, but we'd much rather you showed us your
            work. If you've got a spiffy open source project or portfolio, we'd
            love to take a look! We know these things are rarely perfect, so
            feel free to attach a little summary of the project describing what
            you set out to accomplish and why its neat.
