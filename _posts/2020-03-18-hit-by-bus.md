Is your work held together by duct tape and fate? 

You, and you alone managed to birth this solution within constraints of deadlines/other interesting things, but you know with absolute certainty that it is but a gentle gust of wind away from needing your delicate and nuanced maintenance. It craves the love of its creator... perhaps a bit more than it should. 

But you're going on holiday _soon_. And you've had this job offer loitering in the background for the last few months. And maybe you’re contemplating taking a sabbatical before accepting it. Whatever it is, you know in your bones that your creation won't have you around to nurse it forever. So how can you communicate to your team that your creation has a dependency on you, and you may not necessarily be around **forever**? 

In attempting to convey _“please let me make this less fragile because it needs me too much”_, you could certainly try explain to your peers and superiors the many nuances of your lifestyle, secret side projects, and sabbatical fantasies - but, that won’t be an easy conversation. If you’ve survived the fractal of prodding questions pertaining to your future availability, you’ve at best distracted them from your core point, and at worst become totally derailed by their indifference to your privacy. 

But then, from the corner of your eye, you see it. The solution to all your contrived communication problems. The one liner to save you from a world of heart-ache. Slowly at first, then all at once. Barreling towards you - fast, enormous and... _bright yellow._

_“This solution works most of the time, and it certainly gets the job done but... **What if I got hit by a bus?**”_

The ball is no longer in your court. The hypothetical is no longer in your control. An external, uncontrollable, and (mostly) unforeseeable event can take place at any moment. And if it does... then what? Who will look after you creation? It certainly can’t be you - you’re little more than a splash of crimson on the uncleaned grill of a malevolent school bus.  

You have made the point, and by framing it as a thought experiment, protected yourself from the unintended consequences of group over-analysis of your future. Your code can finally get the love it deserves, without the bureaucratic juggling. And all it took, was the threat of imminent, and inexplicable death... by bus. 

You’re welcome.
