You should never, ever, use lorem-ipsums, if you have any time at all to write some copy that makes sense.

Eye-catching copy makes it quite easier for the reader to skim through the article(s) or whatever you have properly, much closer to what would happen if a user were browsing that website, page or, again, whatever.

Writing interesting, nonsensical, whimsy copy also allow to unwind a bit and perhaps entertain clients, who are often way more bored than we are.
