   We are always looking for talented developers with a range of backgrounds, personalities, 
   and skill sets who love to collaborate on cool projects and products. We're remote friendly. 
   While we require our developers be based in Malta, we're pretty flexible about 
   working outside the office a couple of days a week if you need to.
   We also have Beer Fridays (if you don't drink, no pressure), and an on-premises gym
    is under construction for those who like to squeeze in a few breakfast reps."
